# HollywoodMoviesData-DataViz-UsingTableau
The original dataset that has been used for constructing the visualization can be found using the following link: ‘https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/January/587e7057_movies/movies.csv’. I have performed data cleaning and pre-processing steps (using Jupyter Notebook) on the dataset to convert the dataset into a executable form from the visualization point of view.
